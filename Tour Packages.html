Tour packages Pakistan designing is not that easy, especially when keeping in view the special interest of the tourists. The major difference between the routine tour operators and us is the price strategy that is based on mass tourism that means more volume but low price . The fundamental and instrumental tool for bringing the cost of package down is our philosophy of doing tourism business that is “Do not look at consumer’s pocket but look at Supplier’s pocket”. So, one should not take these tourism incentives that we pass on to the holiday makers by compromising the quality of services that is not the case whereas we never compromise quality irrespective the price less or more. We believe in quality services, even we spend something from our own pocket for the holiday makers. So the Tourist is the King for us!</p>
